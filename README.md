Renaming subtitle file names to match drama file names:

--NOTE1: Before you run the code, make sure the drama and subtitles are in a separate (different) folder.
--The code isn't made to rename subtitles in the same folder as the drama.

--NOTE2: Make sure the drama episodes are in the same order doesn't matter what the order is.
--Example (ep01,ep02,ep03 - subs01,subs02,subs03) or (ep10,ep03,ep07 - subs10,subs03,subs07) both will work fine.
--The script is simple so it is not made to compare file names, it just renames according to the order

--NOTE3: Make sure the number of files in drama folder and subtitles folder are the same.
 
1-Run the file

2-First you input the directory of the drama example: (C:\Dramas\Goblin) don't add an extra \ at the end.

3-Secondly input the directory of the subtitles, example: (C:\Dramas\Goblin\Subs) don't add an extra \ at the end.

4-Finally put the number of episodes (number of video files)

5-You will get a message saying "Done!"

6-That's all!
